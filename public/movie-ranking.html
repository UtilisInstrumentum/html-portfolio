<hr />

<h3>False expectations</h3>
<p>This is movie about the strong bond of love, I really like the cast on this movie.</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>War movie yet it mainly focuses on camaraderie and will, great cast also.</p>

<h3>Contagion</h3>
<p>Sci-fi, yet not too far away from a biosecurity desaster that could unfold except for the zombie like exageration</p>
